<h2> Description</h2>

<p> This lasagna recipe has “rainy Sunday cooking project” written all over it. But, if you’re short on time, you can make both the bechamel and the ragu earlier in the week and pop them into the fridge. You can also make a full tray of this lasagna in advance and freeze it unbaked. Once you do bake it, you’ll be grateful for the leftovers—reheat them uncovered in a 350 degree oven until warmed through and there are crispy bits around the edges.</p>

<p> The secret weapon here is the ragu. Still, you might ask: why in the world would we tell you to make meatballs, brown them, and then break them into pieces after simmering for hours—for a ragù? Sounds crazy, but it’s the best way we found to sear a big batch of meat without overcooking it. This MeatballMethod™ yields deep color (a.k.a. flavor) along with tender meat. If you want to use fresh pasta, go for it. We also tested the recipe with no-boil noodles, but found they soak up a lot more sauce and the lasagna loses its wonderful ooziness; instead, we recommend the regular dried stuff.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2lbs. Ground Pork</li>
        <li>1lbs. Groud Beef</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Medium Onion</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>pasta</li>
        <li>Wine</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>

<h3> Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 225°. Mix pork and beef with your hands in a large bowl; season generously with salt and pepper, then mix again. Form into about 18 large meatballs (they don’t need to be perfect—you’ll be mashing them later).</li>
       
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot looks in danger of scorching, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they’re done.</li>

        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add pancetta and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6–8 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly completely evaporated, 4–5 minutes. Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. Add broth and milk and return meat to pot. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot, leaving lid slightly ajar, and transfer to oven. Bake sauce (no need to stir, but check after 1–2 hours to ensure liquid is at a low simmer, adjusting oven temperature as needed) until meatballs are falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.</li>

        <li>Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù); season with salt and pepper. Reduce over medium-low heat if needed to thicken.</li>

        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking occasionally, until flour begins to smell a bit nutty, about 4 minutes. Quickly whisk in milk and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until béchamel thickens, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, whisking occasionally, until smooth and velvety, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in Parmesan, cayenne, and nutmeg (you should have about 6 cups); season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and use within 1 hour or chill.</li>
